## Rough setup
- Make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com) (comes with macOS and Linux) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
- Open your command line (Terminal app in macOS, Command Prompt in Windows, xterm in Linux)
- clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/fasiha/papilou.git`
- enter the directory you just created `cd papilou.git`
- Download JmdictFurigana.json from https://github.com/Doublevil/JmdictFurigana/releases and put it in this directory
- Download a recent CLDR from https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr-json/releases/ and unzip it here. If it's not `cldr-47`, prefix all commands with `CLDR=path/to/your/cldr`

Run papilou:
```
node papilou.js
```

## Dev notes
Periodically update the `emoji-test.txt` from https://unicode.org/Public/emoji/latest/emoji-test.txt and update the version in this repo.

The Arabic diacritics were generated by https://github.com/CAMeL-Lab/camel_tools

Pinyin was generated by parsechinese.py using `chinese` and `pypinyin`
